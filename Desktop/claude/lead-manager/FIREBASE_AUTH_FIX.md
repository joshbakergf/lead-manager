# 🔧 Firebase Auth Fix Complete!

## The Issue
The "Missing or insufficient permissions" error occurred because:
1. **Using Google Identity Services instead of Firebase Auth**
2. **Firestore security rules expect Firebase Auth tokens**
3. **Rules weren't deployed properly**

## ✅ What I've Fixed

### 1. Switched to Firebase Auth
- ❌ Old: Google Identity Services (browser-only)
- ✅ New: Firebase Auth with Google provider
- ✅ Proper authentication tokens for Firestore

### 2. Updated Authentication Flow
```javascript
// Now using Firebase Auth properly
const result = await signInWithPopup(auth, googleProvider);
// Firestore automatically recognizes the user
```

### 3. Simplified Security Rules
- ✅ Allow all authenticated @go-forth.com users
- ✅ Automatic user creation on first sign-in
- ✅ Domain restriction built-in

## 🚀 What Should Work Now

### After the deployment completes:

1. **Go to**: https://lead-manager-388701133207.us-central1.run.app
2. **Click**: "Sign in with Google"  
3. **Select**: Your @go-forth.com account
4. **Result**: Should automatically sign in and redirect to dashboard

### Expected Console Messages:
```
Starting Firebase Google sign-in...
Firebase sign-in successful: your.email@go-forth.com
Firebase user authenticated: User{...}
```

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Check These Settings:

1. **Google Cloud Console OAuth** (Most Important):
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=interactive-call-script
   - Find: `388701133207-5paj2p5afka0k8nu3uj4av69t930tda9`
   - Add: `https://lead-manager-388701133207.us-central1.run.app` to both sections

2. **Firebase Console** (If needed):
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/interactive-call-script
   - Enable Authentication → Google provider
   - Add authorized domain: `lead-manager-388701133207.us-central1.run.app`

### Manual Rules Deployment (If needed):
The deployment should handle this, but if rules aren't working:

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if you haven't):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   firebase login
   ```

2. **Deploy Rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project interactive-call-script
   ```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### Authentication Flow:
1. **User clicks Google sign-in**
2. **Firebase Auth popup opens**  
3. **User selects @go-forth.com account**
4. **Firebase validates and creates auth token**
5. **Firestore allows access based on token**
6. **User data automatically synced**

### Security:
- ✅ Only @go-forth.com domain allowed
- ✅ Authenticated users can read/write their data
- ✅ Automatic user creation in Firestore
- ✅ Real-time data sync between users

## 🎯 Expected Result

After this fix, you should be able to:
1. ✅ Sign in with Google (no errors)
2. ✅ See your profile in top-right corner
3. ✅ Create/edit scripts (saved to Firestore)
4. ✅ View leads from all team members
5. ✅ Real-time collaboration with other users

The deployment will complete in ~2-3 minutes. Try signing in after that! 🚀
