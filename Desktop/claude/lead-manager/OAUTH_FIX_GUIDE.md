# 🔧 OAuth Configuration Fix

## The Problem
Google sign-in fails because the production domain isn't authorized.

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Access Google Cloud Console
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=interactive-call-script
2. Click on the OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web client)

### Step 2: Add Production URLs
Add these to **Authorized JavaScript origins**:
```
https://lead-manager-388701133207.us-central1.run.app
```

Add these to **Authorized redirect URIs**:
```
https://lead-manager-388701133207.us-central1.run.app
https://lead-manager-388701133207.us-central1.run.app/
```

### Step 3: Save Changes
1. Click "Save" 
2. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate

## 🧪 Test After Configuration

1. Go to: https://lead-manager-388701133207.us-central1.run.app
2. Open Browser Dev Tools (F12) → Console tab
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Look for success messages instead of OAuth errors

## 🔍 Alternative: Check Current OAuth Config

Run this in browser console on the app:
```javascript
console.log('Current domain:', window.location.origin);
```

Should show: `https://lead-manager-388701133207.us-central1.run.app`

## ✅ Expected Results After Fix

- ✅ Google OAuth popup opens
- ✅ Can select @go-forth.com account  
- ✅ Redirects back to app successfully
- ✅ User profile appears in top-right
- ✅ Can access all app features

**This OAuth configuration is the final piece!** 🎯
