# 🎉 Firestore Database Implementation Complete!

## What's Been Set Up

### ✅ Database Structure
Your Lead Manager now uses **Google Firestore** for real-time, multi-user data storage:

| Collection | Purpose | Access |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **users** | User profiles & roles | All users can read, edit own profile |
| **scripts** | Form templates & questions | Managers/Admins create, all read |
| **leads** | Form submissions | Agents submit, managers view all |
| **workflows** | Visual flow logic | Tied to scripts |
| **webhooks** | API connections | Admin only |
| **publishedScripts** | Live forms | Public access |
| **roles** | Permission groups | Admin only |

### 🔐 Security Rules
- **Domain restriction**: Only `@go-forth.com` users
- **Role-based access**: Admin > Manager > Agent
- **Data isolation**: Users only see permitted data

### 🚀 Live Features

1. **Real-time Sync**
   - Changes appear instantly for all users
   - No refresh needed
   - Automatic conflict resolution

2. **Multi-user Collaboration**
   - Multiple users can work simultaneously
   - See who created/edited scripts
   - Track lead assignments

3. **Persistent Storage**
   - Data saved to cloud automatically
   - No more localStorage limitations
   - Accessible from any device

## 📱 How It Works

### Creating a Script
```javascript
// Automatically saved to Firestore
const scriptId = await createScript("New Sales Script", pages);
// All team members see it instantly
```

### Submitting a Lead
```javascript
// Lead saved to database
const leadId = await createLead({
  scriptId: "script123",
  data: formData,
  assignedTo: user.id
});
// Managers see it in real-time
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Environment Variables
All Firebase configuration is built into the deployment:
- API keys configured
- Project ID: `interactive-call-script`
- Database region: `us-central1`

### Data Migration
- First login creates user in Firestore
- Default roles auto-initialized
- Scripts/leads start fresh (no migration from localStorage)

### Performance
- **Free tier**: 50K reads, 20K writes per day
- **Caching**: Firestore caches data locally
- **Offline**: Works offline, syncs when reconnected

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Administrators
1. **Manage Roles**: Control who can create/edit scripts
2. **Monitor Usage**: Track lead submissions
3. **Export Data**: Use Firestore console for exports

### For Managers
1. **Create Scripts**: Build forms that save automatically
2. **View All Leads**: See submissions from all agents
3. **Publish Scripts**: Make forms available to agents

### For Agents
1. **Use Scripts**: Access published forms
2. **Submit Leads**: Data saved instantly
3. **View History**: See your submitted leads

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" Error
- Check user role in Users view
- Ensure logged in with @go-forth.com account

### Data Not Syncing
- Check internet connection
- Refresh page once
- Clear browser cache if needed

### Missing Scripts/Leads
- Data starts fresh with Firestore
- No automatic migration from localStorage
- Create new content as needed

## 📊 Monitoring
